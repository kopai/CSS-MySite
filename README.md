# CSS-MySite

This is my first personal site using html5 and css3 inspired by Angela Yu from App Brewery (The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp).

I just can't wait until github section from the course and I would like to push/pull github files via Atom as when I move around my macbook and PC, I'm just tired of copying my project folders and files from time to time. So I do my research in google and try myself first.
